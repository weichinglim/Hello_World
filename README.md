## **About Me** :information_desk_person:

My name is Wei Ching. I am currently a junior at The University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems. 

I am a newbie in the coding world. I want to learn as much about coding as I can here on GitHub.
My goal is to create my own repository by the end of my spring semester 2021.
In addition to that, I aim to polish my skills to be able to contribute to other repositories.
Some of my hobbies are [baking](https://imgur.com/a/hk7efyK) and discovering new music.
