# Hello_World
Practice Repository
Hello everyone!

I am a newbie in the coding world. I am interested to learn as much about coding as I can here on GitHub.
My goal is to create my own repository by the end of Spring semester 2021.
In addition to that, I aim to polish my skills to be able to contribute to other repositories.
Some of my hobbies are baking and discovering new music.

Thank you for reading. Have a pleasant day!
